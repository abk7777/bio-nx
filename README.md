# Protein Network Analysis with Neo4j
The motivation behind this project is to further integrate the massive amount of biological data being produced by working with graph databases to explore and visualize protein networks using Neo4j.

# Data Sources
* [bioGRID](https://thebiogrid.org/)

# Notes
Examples of nodes:
* Genes
* Protein Complexes
* Drug Molecules and other compounds
* RNA
* Tissue, Organs, System
* Experiments
* Geographic Coordinates
* Specimen samples
* Post-translation Modifications
