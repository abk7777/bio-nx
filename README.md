# bio-nx: Knowledge Graph construction of protein-protein interaction networks

This project is currently under development. It's main goal is to aid researchers in the integration of biological data from different sources (databases, websites) through the automated construction of a Knowledge Graph. 

A knowledge graph allows a team to link data points across different data sources such as databases, APIs, literature and websites. It provides a high level overview of the relationships between everything, from academic papers, experiments, subjects of inquiry such as genes or protein interactions, disease conditions, and even GPS coordinates. The primary advantage offered by a knowledge graph is the ability to access the immediate context of any data point, something that tabular data such as spreadsheets or RDBMS cannot easily do. This can both save time and expedite discovery.

The exponential accumulation of biological data presents a formidable challenge when it comes to integration and extraction of actionable insights. `bionx` aims to provide a portable approach to the cataloguing, organization and exploration of biological data by integrating across multiple sources into a single knowledge graph.
